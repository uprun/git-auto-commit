# git-auto-commit
creates a commit on each change of the file

## supported scenarios
1) you have one "main" branch from which you create feature branches

2) you are a solo developer (I will add support for multiple people later)

## goals of the project:
This is targetting solo developers, in order to support open-development paradigm
So commit on every change

## remarks aka known issues
probably will not work with rebasing

[X] switch to main branch does not work from the first time (fixed now)

[ ] there are a lot of branches, I need to remove automatically them
